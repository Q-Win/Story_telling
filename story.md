Who are you:
  I came to Turing to learn coding. I wanted to learn coding for a variety of
  reasons but one reason was to help others. I believe it will be a valuable skill
  in the future and being able to help others learn it will be important

Why are you here:

  I am at Turing because I like the learning environment. I tried to self teach
  myself coding but always found it over whelming. Turing has given me a
  curriculum and path to follow.

What's next:

  For now I would like to continue building my technical skills. Being at Turing
  has freed up my mind to be able to just focus on coding. I hope one day to be
  able to help other get into coding so tech doesn't leave them behind.


The hardest part about story telling for me is talking about myself. I've never
been a big fan of being the center of attention. I think if I write out my story,
ponder it, and edit it enough times I will feel comfortable telling it.
